Lagwagon - Of Mind and Matter

They spoke bravely
It opened our eyes
We swallowed their pride
A new era
So whee is the new advise
It seems the older methods no longer suffice
The very oldeest if thoughts
Cast into the mold of these new times
Vindictive, he raises his fist
The animal is instinctive
Everyone desires peace
But indread of war,
Still arms increase
Perpetual with only one end
When that savage nature destroys them all
All is written
All is forgiven
All is lived again
After all, this worthless progress
Is progress made for change
After all these vain advances
Does that concerned animal value his life?
Cornered
Human nature alive
